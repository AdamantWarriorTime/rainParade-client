# Rain On Your Parade
Planning an event takes a lot of effort. The last thing you want to happen on your big day is to have Mother nature come crashing it with rain. So, never again let it rain on your parade by using our app Rain On Your Parade. Our app takes in simply two information about your event, the location and its date. It will then look into 10 years of weather forecast to see how often it has rained on said date. Rain On Your Parade also gives in-depth detail on other important information, like temperature and past forecast for each of the preceding years. Because we all know history repeats itself, with this app you can choose the best date for your next event!
